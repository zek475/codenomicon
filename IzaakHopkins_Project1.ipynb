    "Hello! I am very excited to share this project!!! I have always been interested in game design, so I thought this app-development project would be the perfect opportunity to try making a game myself. Once I started coding the game, I was having a lot of fun and kept on adding more and more things. I ended up putting A LOT of hours into this, between writing actual code and figuring out how to code certain sequences. I keep finding myself coming back and wanting to add more, but I need a stopping point so here I am. I hope you enjoy!\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "I wanted to create a text adventure game that has both a set story, but enough random sequences for replayability.\\\n",
    "What I've come up with is this game: ***Venshura***\\\n",
    "Venshua can be thought of as 3 separate sections: **The Prologue**, **The Game**, and **The Final Boss**.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "**Theoretically, this game could go on forever, so I've limited the requirement for the final boss to be only level 3... This means the 'demo' of the game should only be ~10 minutes long.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Prologue\n",
    "The prologue is called in the executable code through the function gamestart().This function uses the print function to introduce the player to the world and sets the scene for the game. \n",
    "The prologue is also the first occurance of the 'time' library, which I imported as 'tm' for ease of use. The only function I use from this library is 'sleep', which is simply to create a pause between text lines to allow the player time to read.\n",
    "It also uses the input function as a tool to get the player's name and store it in the executable code for later use.\\\n",
    "![Prologue](https://i.ibb.co/3T3DKSR/pro.png)\n",
    "The prologue is also the first instance where I use text fomatting. I found a guide on stack overflow with the escape characters to allow me to print certain game lines with bold, underline, and different color shades. \n",
    "They all resemble the pattern **'\\\\033\\[##m'** , with different #'s representing different text formats. These are seen throughout all of my code, in order to organize and beautify the game's text.\n",
    "![Formatting](https://i.ibb.co/wpqtC1k/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-8-51-02-PM.png)\n",
    "## The Game\n",
    "The meat of the gameplay is in the middle section of the game, known as 'The Path'. This is the part of the game that uses random sequences, so it could theoretically go on forever. The way to break the WHILE loop which repeatedly has the player continue down the path is to meet the level requirement. As I said above, for demonstration purposes the level requirement is only set to 3. I would think a level reuirement of 10 would be a good number if this were to be a full game. I use the 'random' library, imported as rd, quite a lot; specifically, the 'randint' function. I use this function a lot to generate random values to decide what the player will encounter next. I also use this function to create random enemy names using a list of values, and having a random number generate to index the list.\\\n",
    "On the path, one of two things can happen: There is a 80\\% chance to trigger a combat sequence using the combat() function and 20\\% chance to trigger a friendly encounter using the gift() function.\\\n",
    "*A snapshot of my code for this is below:*\\\n",
    "![Route](https://i.ibb.co/QD1vJSG/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-9-49-23-PM.png)\n",
    ">### Combat  \n",
    "![Combat](https://i.ibb.co/8rSL4Y0/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-8-53-17-PM.png)\n",
    "The combat of this game is based on 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', with a few changes and upgrades...\\\n",
    "Similar to 'Rock, Paper, Scissors': ***MELEE beats MAGIC, MAGIC beats RANGED, RANGED beats MELEE***\\\n",
    "The player will pick their attack, and a random number will generate to decide the enemy's attack.\n",
    "**But, If you both pick the same attack you CLASH** and the function tiebreaker() is called.\\\n",
    "![Tiebreaker](https://i.ibb.co/Pwps0LL/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-9-48-00-PM.png)\n",
    "**TIEBREAKER**: After clashing attacks with your enemy they become stunned, and you must then decide to either       **COUNTER or GUARD**. COUNTER will give you a chance to attack, but leave you vulnerable if your enemy doesn't stay stunned. GUARD will allow you to ensure that you take no damage, but you will lose the opportunity to counter-attack even if your enemy stays stunned. A random number is generated to decide if the enemy stays stunned.\\\n",
    "All of this is done using IF functions to check the randomly generated attacks from the enemy against the user's input for each round.\\\n",
    "The function checks many iterations of uppercase/lowercase options for each selection, and will also prompt the user again if the input is invalid.\\\n",
    "*A snapshot of my code for this is below:*\n",
    "![CombatCode](https://i.ibb.co/PxSLwLJ/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-9-51-51-PM.png)\n",
    "After each round, damage is done to the loser's health points based on the winner's attack damage.\\\n",
    "Player's max health points starts at 100 and attack damage starts at 15, but can be increased with potions and by leveling up.\\\n",
    "Enemy's attack damage and health points are generated as a random number.\\\n",
    "Losing all health points in battle will only result in earning no experience, but definite loss in pride.\\\n",
    "Health Points are reset to the Max Health Stat at the beginning of a new encounter.\\\n",
    "Winning a combat sequence results in gaining experience points based on the enemy's attack damage.\\\n",
    "The experince point requirement to level-up starts at 10 points and increases by 5 points each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Friendly Encounter\n",
    "![Friendly](https://i.ibb.co/CBdhwHF/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-9-00-44-PM.png)\n",
    "Each time a friendly encounter occurs, the player meets an NPC of a random type and occupation.\\\n",
    "The NPC will gift the player a choice of a HEALTH POTION, ATTACK POTION, or an EXPERIENCE POTION.\\\n",
    "The HEALTH POTION increases the player's Max Health by 10, the ATTACK POTION increases the player's attack damage by 5, and the EXPERIENCE POTION gives the player 5 experience points.\\\n",
    "**Since I made the game shorter for the demo, the likelihood of finding a friendly encounter by level 3 is low... So I hard-coded in a free friendly encounter directly after the prologue to showcase the sequence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Boss\n",
    "I'm proud of my concept for the final boss, It's simple but very effective!\\\n",
    "The final sequence of the game starts when the level requirement is reached. ie. the WHILE loop is terminated and the final function, dungeon(), is called in the executable code. After some text is printed to add some story, the  fight starts.\\\n",
    "**It's based on the game 'Hangman'**, but the story at the start of the dungeon() function ties it in to be a fight scene!\\\n",
    "The function again uses the 'randint' function to choose a random word from a defined list of words.\\\n",
    "***The player is prompted to guess a letter (IN UPPERCASE) to try and defeat the boss.***\\\n",
    "![Bossfight](https://i.ibb.co/y6CYjBF/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-8-57-56-PM.png)\n",
    "The function then uses a WHILE loop coupled with mutiple IF statements to check if the letter is in the random word.\\\n",
    "And it uses a FOR loop on the string of the random word to have it display what letters of the random word have been guessed.\\\n",
    "*A snapshot of my code for this is below:*\n",
    "![BossCode](https://i.ibb.co/19gt3Ms/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-9-50-05-PM.png)\n",
    "If the player guesses an incorrect letter, they lose 10 health points\\\n",
    "If the player loses all of their health points, they have to start over at the start of the dungeon.\\\n",
    "But if the player guesses all of the correct letters and solves the word, they defeat the boss and beat the game.\n",
    "![Endgame](https://i.ibb.co/Fx8vjj2/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-8-59-18-PM.png)\n"
